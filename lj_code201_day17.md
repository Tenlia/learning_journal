Today was mostly about getting everyone on the same page. We A-C-P-ed a LOT. We had to sort out a small merge conflict earlier this morning. But that was easy and everyone worked together to get it handled.

Teamwork isn't really a problem with us but we can get a little lost in trying to plan things out, I would like some clearer thinking when it comes to laying-out what our goals are.
