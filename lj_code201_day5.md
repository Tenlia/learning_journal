Okay, today we learned some crazy amount of stuff to do with Github and CSS and were basically forced to think about functions from a different viewpoint.

I felt that I learned a lot about using the order of code to not only make it readable for others later but also for making the page load efficiently.

I definitely am working on understanding Github and working with it, I might not be able to visualize it that well, but I check and double-check everything before I start a new branch or change any of the code.

The talks on CSS were pretty good, I think that pairing the lectures with the book I should have a pretty good starting point to work on making my website look actually presentable. I'm not horribly good at computer-layouts, which is frustrating because I love to do art by hand and I can be pretty decent at that. But for some reason, every time I try to tackle web-pages I make them look atrocious!

Basically, I appreciate any help I can get.
