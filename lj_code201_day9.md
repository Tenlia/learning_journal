I learned just how hard it is to mess with CSS, today. Mostly about trying to keep everything in order and in-line, I didn't do a very good job but I learned what I can do to make it better. Next time I work on it, I'm reorganizing everything so that it makes more sense. I think I didn't do proper indentation, either. I need to look at Brian's example again and see what else I can pick up from it.

also, CSS makes working with pictures surprisingly hard if you're trying to layer them over something else.
