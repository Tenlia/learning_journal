Today I learned about pair-programming, which was lots of fun.

I learned about forking someone else's repository and pull-requests, I will definitely be using that in future projects.

There were also so many CSS terms, I would like to start going into greater detail on my journals later because it's kind of confusing how to put everything down in here.

Maybe we can learn about Merge problems in the future (I heard they happen and would like to be prepared!)
