Today was a tough one. But I learned so much about structuring an object, I will probably practice this more as we go. But I found it very handy for handling variables and functions in relation to one need and it was easy to duplicate after getting the one problem correct.

I think that a lot of this data would probably fit-together better as a table, maybe that's a future project? (based on the reading...)
