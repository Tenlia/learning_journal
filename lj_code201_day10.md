I learned a lot about teamwork when it comes to building code. If you're not exact in communicating your expectations or what you intend to do then people start getting left behind and frustrated. I was having a hard time finishing anything with my partner because communicating with CSS is actually surprisingly hard. I would point something out and then problem solve and she'd be wondering what was going on. It can take so much longer with someone else... BUT it does make it easier to spot some mistakes when you force the communication.
