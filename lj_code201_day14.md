Today's lectures were definitely good, I liked learning more about illustrations! I might not have much of a use for illustration in the current project but I know of a certain, personal project that it will come in very handy for.
I think my team works very well together, we're all interested in communicating thoroughly before committing to an idea. And we like to work with each-other which is a big plus!
