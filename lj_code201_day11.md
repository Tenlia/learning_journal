Today was a tough one, I didn't really feel like I grasped my material all that well... But in the end I managed to get something together that put random images on the page. I think I will start making myself get help as often as possible, and take some actual breaks so that I can refocus and see what I need to do. Thanks to everyone for putting up with my sometimes circular questions!
