Okay, today was great! I didn't finish the work entirely... but I did rewrite yesterday's work and understand it so much better! I know I've already said it everywhere else, but the lecture really helped me to think through the process. Learning to put the data on the chart was kinda mind-blowing, though, because it's a little hard to troubleshoot your work when it relies so heavily on a chunk of someone else's code that you can't actually sort through.
