I feel that I learned a lot about fleshing out an idea for a website, today. I thought I had lots of angles thought-out about what I would like to make. The questions got me thinking about what was important, though, and how it would be presented to the audience. I even started making drawings of how the website could work and what stretch goals we could have. I'm very excited for project week, now!
