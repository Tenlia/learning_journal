Today was definitely about communication. It was interesting trying to get everyone's ideas hashed-out and down on paper. You certainly notice when one slipped through the cracks because someone would randomly bring something up as a "maybe..." when we were presenting our project.
I think that we work really well as a team and that we're learning together about what we can do. I like that we're not reaching too hard right away but have some nice, ambitious stretch goals.
