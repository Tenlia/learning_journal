I think we all learned how you have to work around others on a project that takes this long to get done. I think that we were just tired of some of the process of meetings and cleaning up after each other, today.

I think that a few of my opinions might have been taken a little personally today? There weren't any conflicts but I felt a little like I'd worn someone's nerve over the last week.
