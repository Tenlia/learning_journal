Today went really well, we got our MVP and worked on more styling to make our page look really nice!

I think that we communicated really well, today. We also listened to each other and referred to each other a lot for help when we were having trouble. This definitely made the work go faster and we spotted a lot of errors that we might not have gotten otherwise.
