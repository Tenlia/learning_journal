This weekend was totally crazy, I had a lot of fun working on the framework and styling for the main pages.

We essentially decided to stick to our own pages and not touch the pages others would work on and carefully laid-out who would need what pages. But I still wound-up working on two documents that others were working on. It was an easy fix, though, and good practice for future merge conflicts.
